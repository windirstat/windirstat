Last modified: $Date$
=============================================================

2004-11-25	assarbad
	* Removal of obsolete functions IsCompressed() and
	  IsEncrypted().
	* Optimised use of GetCompressedFileSize() API which is
	  now cached in the application object similar to PSAPI.
	* Removed manifest and respective file for Russian and
	  the manifest file for German ressources.
	* Fixed coloring bug upon error codes #2 and #123 which
	  happens using the ANSI version on files with Unicode
	  names which cannot be mapped to ANSI names.
	* Implemented the column to show file attributes.

2004-11-24	bseifert
	* Eliminated hidden option "ExplorerStyle". The directory
	  list context menu now appears horizontally at the cursor 
	  position and vertically under (or above) the label.
	  
2004-11-23	bseifert
	* Bugfix: About-Dialog: When the RichEdit control had
	  the focus, pressing the ESC key made id disappear.
	  Now ESC (and TAB) merly move the focus to the tab
	  control.

2004-11-19	bseifert
	* Setup optionally installs a link to windirstat in the
	  SendTo-Folder.

2004-11-15	assarbad
	* Russian translation (still a few strings missing) 
	  - thanks to Sergiy Polyetayev

2004-11-14	bseifert/assarbad
	* Date/time and number formatting is now done using
	  GetUserDefaultLangID(), unless the new option
	  "Use this language for formatting" (near the language
	  combo box) is selected.
	  So British users, for example, see their preferred
	  date/time format as configured in the control panel
	  although the selected language for Windirstat is
	  "English - US".
	* Last used folder now pre-selected
	   
2004-11-12  bseifert
	* Added Polish resource dll: wdsr0415. Thanks to Darek.
	* New output folders for Unicode build: udebug, urelease
	* Eliminated CLR_NONE
	* Minor formatting and error handling corrections
	
2004-11-12	assarbad
	* Coloring for compressed and encrypted items spans the
	  full row (for list control in another state than "Full
	  row select" the style needs to be decided, yet).
	* Renamed "Table Of Contents.hhc" to toc.hhc, as Linux
	  CVS cannot handle filenames with blanks in them.
	* Implemented ExplorerStyle option which will not be
	  accessible through the options dialog.
	  It handles where the context menu is being shown.

2004-11-07	assarbad/bseifert
	* French part for setup.rc
	* Minor bugfix concerning "follow junction points"
	* Using compressed file size as reference now. This includes
	  compressed and sparse files. A wrapper makes this transparent
	  for the caller.
	* Compressed files/folders are now shown by default in blue,
	  encrypted files/folders are shown by default in green.
	  These settings can be altered by modifying the two
	  REG_BINARY values "AltColor" (for compressed) and
	  "AltEncryptionColor" (for encrypted) under the key:
          
	  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer

	  This mimics the behavior of the Windows XP explorer.

2004-11-06	assarbad
	* Added the CVS-tags for Date and History whereever appropriate.
	  (already yesterday)
	* Sam from the Ultr@VNC [ultravnc.sf.net] project volunteered to
	  translate the missing parts to French. Still necessary to check
	  wether the design is broken.
	* Fixed the bug with ampersands. If file or directory names have an
	  ampersand they would show with underbar under the character right
	  to the ampersand. This is similar to the behavior of accelerators
	  in Windows dialogs. Just added DT_NOPREFX to all DrawText()
	  instances.

2004-11-02	assarbad
	* Replaced the custom icon for junction points by code to greenify
	  the folder image. Thus junction points are now represented by green
	  folder icons.
	* ANSI/Unicode DLLs and EXEs now have the same name. No more appended
	  "U" (which broke several things such as localization).

2004-10-31	assarbad
	* Added option to ignore junction points (reparse points) for
	  those directories not being volume mount points already.
	* Added the respective icon to represent junction points.
	* Translation to German and French not yet done for the newly
	  added items.

2004-01-22	bseifert
	* Release of 1.1.0 with unknown changes by Bernhard.
      [This entry was added as late as 2004-11-06]

2004-01-20	bseifert
	* Temporarily removed French translation from setup and Aboutbox for release 1.0.2.
	* New option: Full row selection (default).

2004-01-11	bseifert	
	* Completed French translation.
	* Added rc2-files.
	
2003-01-02	bseifert
	* Added the French resources to setup.exe.
	* Internal bugfix: the cleanup actions are now disabled, if
	  the extension list has the focus.
	* 'Command prompt here' is now disabled for UNC paths.
	* Drive selection dialog: the set of selected drives was not
	  always persistent.
	* Drive selection dialog: If the drives list has no focus and
	  the selection is not empty, the first mouse click on the 
	  drives list merley sets focus and the radio button.
	* Setup.exe: If the user enters a relative path, it is now
	  expanded when the Next button is pressed.
	  
2004-01-01	bseifert
	* All file VERSIONINFOs are now conforming to Windows.
	  Introduced automatic update of build number.
	* The lists now realize when system colors change, and the
	  program needs not to be restarted.
	  Text- and item highlight colors are no longer hardcoded.
	* Options: 'Pacman animation' and 'Show time spent' have
	  been moved to the page 'Directory list'.
	  'Show grid' and the new option 'Show stripes' have been
	  moved to the General page and now apply to all lists.
	* Options 'General': When the language has been changed, the user
	  is now prompted for restarting Windirstat.
	* Directory list: During the scan it was hard to manipulate
	  items with mouse clicks due to the periodical re-sort.
	  Now mouse messages are processed before the re-sort, so it
	  is more likely to hit the wanted item.
	* Directory list: During the scan it was hard to navigate
	  in the tree because the selection was auto-scrolled into
	  view every 0.6 sec. This is now removed.
	* Directory list: The context menu key didn't work. Fixed.
	  Corrected right mouse button handling.
	  Context menu now has default items (expand, collapse or open).
	  A double click on a file opens the file.
	* Treemap: Small selection rectangles were not painted correctly.
	
2003-12-29	bseifert
	* Page User defined cleanups: Select the cleanup No 9. Empty
	  its title. In the list click below cleanup No. 9.
	  --> The program crashed (invalid pointer). Fixed.
	* The 'Send e-mail to owner' report can now be customized.
	* The default title for user defined cleanups is now no longer
	  stored as string to the registry. So, after changing the language, it
	  now appears in the new language.
	* SUBST'd drives are now excluded from "All local drives"
	  (doesn't work on W9x).
	* There was a duplicate error message, when "Show Properties" or
	  "Explorer here" failed.
	
2003-12-27	bseifert
	* Selection of types: When the extension list has the focus,
	  the treemap highlights all files of the given extension.
	* Focus can now be moved between directory list and extension list
	  via TAB key. Selection can be canceled with ESC key.
	
2003-12-24	bseifert
	* RESOURCEVERSION is now 3. This means that windirstat.exe 
	    will not load resource dlls of previous versions.
	* Treemap algorithm now isolated in treemap.h/treemap.cpp.
	  Two squarification styles: KDirStat-like, SequoiaView-like.
	  Two new parameters: brightness and position of the light source.
	  Treemap-options-page completely reworked:
	  - true treemap preview
	  - 4 big sliders and a 2D-Slider
	* Resizable dialogs: fixed repainting problem.

2003-12-13	bseifert
	* Added size grippers to the resizable dialogs.
	* Corrections in French windirstat.rc
	* Made "Bytes", "KB", "MB, "GB", "TB" localizable.

2003-12-07	bseifert
	* User defined cleanups are now by default disabled for UNC paths.
	  New option to enable udcs for UNC paths.
	* Drive Selection Dialog: Foldername field: Validation took a long
	  time, if UNC paths were entered using the keyboard. Validation
	  is now turned off, if the path begins with \\.
	  
2003-12-07	bseifert
	* If the localized help file is not found, the English one is now tried.
	* New shortcut F5 for 'Refresh Selected'.
	* English version: '?' renamed to 'Help'.
	* Select Drives Dialog: now queries the drives via background threads.
	* tigroo almost finished French translation of windirstat.rc.
	* When the tree is empty (drive selection canceled), the program
	    crashed after 'Empty Recycle Bin'. It also crashed when 
	    'Show free space' or 'Show unknown' was selected.
	* Due to a bug, 'Empty Recycle Bin' was always enabled, even when
	    the recycle bin was empty.
	* Due to a bug, 'Empty Recycle Bin' was never enabled on W2k.

2003-12-03	bseifert
	* Select Drives Dialog: 'A Folder' field: Relative paths and
	    trailing backslashes are now handled correctly.
	* Added "Thanks to" beta testers.
	* Contextmenu and doubleclick didn't work correctly if Name-column wasn't leftmost.

	* Version number '1.0.1rc3'
	* Placed platform.h/cpp into 'common' folder.
	* Pacman is now symmetric on NT AND 9x.
	
2003-11-25	bseifert
	* With slow drives (diskettes), the program crashed, when activating 
	    or deactivating "show free space" or "show unknown".
	* Program could crash when the color column in the extension list was
	    made too small.
	* By mistake, the <Files>-icon reflected the working directory
	    (this could possibly be a drive-icon). Fixed.
	* Made pacman more symmetric.
	* The <Free space>-icon didn't look green on some systems.
	* Fixed repainting problem of header control of extension list.
	* Refined the drawing of subtree percentage.
	* The lists don't flicker any more when scrolling down.
	* Date/Time is now formatted rather by the selected language than the LocaleDefault.
	* RESOURCEVERSION is now 2. This means that windirstat.exe 
	    will not load resource dlls of previous versions.
	* Added column "% Bytes" to extension list.
